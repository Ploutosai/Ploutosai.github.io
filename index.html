        <h3>Understanding Batch Size in Deep Learning</h3>
        <p>Hyper-parameters like batch_size are crucial in Deep Learning and AI. A batch is a subset of data used in a single iteration of training, after which model parameters are updated. Discover why choosing the right batch_size is more of an art than a science in this <a href="https://www.ploutos.dev/experience/229df7ca-6861-11ee-9af7-0242ac110002">tutorial and demo</a>. #deeplearning #batchsize #gpu #llms</p>
