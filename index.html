        <h3>Understanding Batch Size in Deep Learning</h3>
        <p>Hyper-parameters like batch_size are crucial in Deep Learning and AI. A batch is a subset of data used in a single iteration of training, after which model parameters are updated. Discover why choosing the right batch_size is more of an art than a science in this <a href="https://www.ploutos.dev/experience/229df7ca-6861-11ee-9af7-0242ac110002">tutorial and demo</a>. #deeplearning #batchsize #gpu #llms</p>

        <h3>An example that demonstrates how pytorch matrix multiplication is ~20 times faster than its numpy counterpart</h3>
        <p>Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch or even fine-tuning them requires a tremendous amount of computational resources. Matrix operations, which include matrix multiplication as well as various other computations, form the backbone of deep learning. Given the massive scale of these operations, the speed of computation is crucial. Thatâ€™s why frameworks like PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow leverage the power of GPUs, which are highly efficient at handling parallel computations required for these matrix operations. For example, matrix multiplication in PyTorch with GPU acceleration can be substantially faster compared to using NumPy on a CPU. Check out this simple example that demonstrates how pytorch matrix multiplication is ~20 times faster than its numpy counterpart. <a href="https://www.ploutos.dev/experience/0da41a2a-6848-11ee-ae60-0242ac110002#summary">Learn more</a>!</p>
